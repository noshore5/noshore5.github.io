Not all those who wander are lost.
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places.
Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens.
There is some good in this world, and it's worth fighting for.
It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door.
Courage is found in unlikely places.
The wise speak only of what they know.
Little by little, one travels far.
The road goes ever on and on.
Deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised.
All that is gold does not glitter.
Short cuts make long delays.
Moonlight drowns out all but the brightest stars.
Go not to the Elves for counsel, for they will say both yes and no.
The greatest adventure is what lies ahead.
May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out.
War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all.
The wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot forever fence it out.
